_Geometric Optics: Basics_ is a simplified version of the _Geometric Optics_ simulation, and shares the same model.
Please see [geometric-optics/doc/model.md](https://github.com/phetsims/geometric-optics/blob/main/doc/model.md) for
model details.

Simplifications include:

* The _Lens_ screen supports a convex lens only.
* The _Mirror_ screen supports a flat mirror only.
