_Geometric Optics: Basics_ is a simplified version of the _Geometric Optics_ simulation, and shares the same
implementation. Please
see [geometric-optics/doc/implementation-notes.md](https://github.com/phetsims/geometric-optics/blob/main/doc/implementation-notes.md)
for implementation details.

To identify modifications that are specific to _Geometric Optics: Basics_:

* Inspect
  [geometric-optics-basics-main.ts](https://github.com/phetsims/geometric-optics-basics/blob/main/js/geometric-optics-basics-main.ts).
* Search for occurrences of the `isBasicsVersion` flag in geometric-optics code.

From https://github.com/phetsims/geometric-optics-basics/issues/2, here's a summary of how _Geometric Optics: Basics_
differs from _Geometric Optics_. Unless specifically noted, these differences can be "undone" via PhET-iO.

Both screens:

* "Second Point" checkbox in the control panel is hidden. It is possible to make it visible via PhET-iO.
* When the "Labels" checkbox is checked, use labels "Object" and "Real/Virtual Image" for the first object/image. If a
  second object is made visible, use labels "Object 1" and "Real/Virtual Image 1" for the first object/image, "Object 2"
  and "Real/Virtual Image 2" for the second object/image.

_Lens_ screen:

* Convex lens only. It is possible to select concave lens via PhET-iO, or via the UI if radio buttons are made visible
  via PhET-iO.
* Radio buttons to select the optic shape are hidden. It is possible to make them visible via PhET-iO.

_Mirror_ screen:

* Flat mirror only. It is NOT possible to add concave and convex mirror via PhET-iO.
* Since we have only a flat mirror, optical objects can be moved freely, rather than being constrained to horizontal
  motion.
* Since there is only one mirror shape, hide the radio button. It is not possible to make it visible via PhET-iO,
  because it is not instrumented.
* Since we have only a flat mirror, move the mirror to the same screen coordinates as the lens.
* Because the F and 2F points for a flat mirror are located at infinity, there are no checkboxes for “Focal Points”
  and "2F Points" in the control panel. It is NOT possible to add them via PhET-iO.
* Change screen icon to a flat mirror. This cannot be changed via PhET-iO.

Preferences > Simulation:

* Default `focalLengthControlTypeProperty` to 'direct'.
* Default `add2FPointsCheckboxProperty` to `true`, so that "2F Points" checkbox is visible on the _Lens_ screen. This
  control will not affect the _Mirror_ screen.
